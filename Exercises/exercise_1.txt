Exercises
=========

1. Define a function which takes a string as its argument.
   It should print the characters of the string one at a time.
   First solution should use a while loop and the second solution should implement a For loop
   
2. Enhance the above function with a second argument to the function.
   Sample function definition:
        
        def displayChar( string, reverse=False):
            .....
            .....
            
   If reverse is True it should print the chars in reverse order.
   
3. Define a function which will accept a string as argument and return True
   if the string is a palindrome. Palindrome is a word in English which when read backwards from the last letter 
   to first spells the   same. example:- Madam, Radar, Solos etc
   
   Hint: Use string slicing using str[start:stop:step]
    
4. Create a dictionary with keys as strings and values as integers.
   List the keys in alphabetical order.
   List the values from lower to higher
   
5. Take a dictionary as input and create another dictionary by inverting the keys and values.
   ie, the values becomes the key and the keys become the values.


6. Take an input from the user for a test score and return the grade as per below scale:
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: <60

7. Complete the below script to implement a Queue using list in python. Fill up the code in the functions: enQ, deQ and viewQ

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
​
queue = []
​
def enQ():
    'Add the item to the end of the queue'
    item = raw_input('Enter an integer or string to add to the queue: ').strip()
    pass
​
def deQ():
    'Pop out an item from the beginning of the queue'
    pass
​
def viewQ():
    'Display the current contents in the queue'
    pass
​
def exit():
    print 'Exiting'
​
CMDS = {'e': enQ, 'd': deQ, 'v': viewQ, 'q': exit}
​
def main():
    menu = """
    (E)nqueue
    (D)equeue
    (V)iew
    (Q)uit
    
    Enter choice: """
    
    while True:
        while True:
            try:
               choice = raw_input(menu).strip()[0].lower()
            except (EOFerror, KeyboardInterrupt, indexError):
                choice = 'q'
            
            print '\nYou picked: [%s]' % choice
            if choice not in CMDS:
                print 'Invalid option, try again'
            else:
                break
        CMDS[choice]()
        if choice == 'q':
            break
​
​
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

	
8. Write a program which will accept a number between 0-100 and output the english language equivalent of it. 
   for example an input of 89 should give the output as eighty nine and so on.


9. Write a program which accepts a date in MM/DD/YYYY format and calculates the difference between it and current date in days.

10. Make an connection to an sqlite db.
	- Create a table with the below structure:
	Table Name: employee
	columns: 
		id    STRING
		name  STRING
		dob   DATETIME
		dept  STRING
		addr  STRING
	- Insert the below records into it:
	1 'Joe'   'Human Resources' 12\10\1976  'North Lane, Seattle'
	2 'David' 'Manufacturing'   15\03\1978  '10, Downing street, London'
	3 'Mary'  'Sales'           03\04\1982  'Capitol hill, Washington'

	- Execute a query to fetch name and dept of employees born after 01/01/1977
