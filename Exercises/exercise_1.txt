Exercises
=========

1. Define a function which takes a string as its argument.
   It should print the characters of the string one at a time.
   First solution should use a while loop and the second solution should implement a For loop
   
2. Enhance the above function with a second argument to the function.
   Sample function definition:
        
        def displayChar( string, reverse=False):
            .....
            .....
            
   If reverse is True it should print the chars in reverse order.
   
3. Define a function which will accept a string as argument and return True
   if the string is a palindrome. Palindrome is a word in English which when read backwards from the last letter 
   to first spells the   same. example:- Madam, Radar, Solos etc
   
   Hint: Use string slicing using str[start:stop:step]
    
4. Create a dictionary with keys as strings and values as integers.
   List the keys in alphabetical order.
   List the values from lower to higher
   
5. Take a dictionary as input and create another dictionary by inverting the keys and values.
   ie, the values becomes the key and the keys become the values.
